Idea #1: Online Job Application Tracker
Objective
Develop a web platform to help users track, organize, and manage job applications using automation and AI.

Key Features
Automated Tracking – Users can manually input job applications or paste job descriptions.
Email Integration – Connect with Gmail to detect job-related emails and update application status.
LinkedIn Search – Find PSU alumni or employees at applied companies.
AI Insights – Use DeepSeek API or a custom AI model to extract recruiter emails and summarize job postings.
Dashboard – Track applications with categories like Hot (responses received), Cold (no response), and Dead (rejected).
User Customization – Mark emails as read, update application status, and generate local backups in CSV, JSON, or PDF.
Report Generation – Send job summaries via email.
Explainer Video – Consider outsourcing to Fiverr for a promotional video.
Technologies
AWS, Flask/Django, React/Next.js, PostgreSQL/MySQL, Gmail API, LinkedIn API, AI Summarization

A streamlined system to help job seekers efficiently track applications and follow up on opportunities.

What Should I Learn for Computer Science?
Essential Programming Languages & Frameworks
1. Python
Why? Useful for backend development, AI/ML, and automation.

Backend Web Development – Django, Flask, FastAPI
Data Science & Machine Learning – TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Automation & Scripting – Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
Recommended Starting Point – Flask for APIs, Pandas for data, FastAPI for scalable backend development
2. JavaScript
Why? Essential for web development (frontend & backend).

Frontend Frameworks – React.js, Next.js, Vue.js
Backend Frameworks – Node.js, Express.js, NestJS
Databases & APIs – GraphQL, Firebase
Recommended Starting Point – React for frontend, Node.js + Express for backend
3. Java
Why? Best for backend development, enterprise apps, and Android.

Backend Web Development – Spring Boot, Hibernate
Android Development – Android SDK, Jetpack, Kotlin
Enterprise & Cloud Applications – Jakarta EE, Micronaut
Recommended Starting Point – Spring Boot for backend development
4. SQL
Why? Required for backend and data-driven applications.

Databases – PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
ORM Frameworks – SQLAlchemy (Python), Prisma (JavaScript), Hibernate (Java)
Big Data & Cloud Integration – Google BigQuery, AWS RDS
Recommended Starting Point – PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy or Prisma for backend projects
5. Go (Golang)
Why? Best for high-performance backend, cloud computing, and microservices.

Web Frameworks & APIs – Gin, Fiber, Echo
Cloud & Distributed Systems – Kubernetes, Docker
Concurrency & High Performance – gRPC, Cobra
Recommended Starting Point – Gin for web APIs, Docker for deployment
Which One Should You Learn First?
Web Development – JavaScript (React + Node.js)
Backend & AI – Python (Flask + TensorFlow)
Enterprise Development – Java (Spring Boot)
