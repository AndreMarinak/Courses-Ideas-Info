•AWS
•ONLINE SITE TO ORGANIE APPLICATIONS FROM TEXT/link INPUTS - Link with applciation email or gmail to give automation - give user control on automactic or not
-Search linkedin for people to email that work there any are psu alumni 
-Train own model or use RAG to identify emails and allow pasting in job description
-Use deepseek to maybe make my own API to use AI when needed to search/summarize
-Outsource to fiver for a video to explain what it is
-What does it do? Allow a dashboard of job applications and show the data applied, contacts reached out to (user input), any updates from that company that were sent to an email,
--if a follow up email was sent, important people related to the job if someone reached out
--Have different tabs for filtering applications like HOT ones (got replies/contacts there), cold (nothing yet), dead(got rejected)
-Allow user configuration for things like mark emails as read, update if an application is dead(got denied),
-Give local backups to the user in some format -Long and short maybe pdf to their email?
•Add things like Company Name, job description, location, pay,

# 📌 Essential Programming Languages & Frameworks for Software Engineering

If you're aiming to become a **strong software engineer**, these are the **top 5 programming languages** and the **key frameworks** to learn with each.

---

## 🚀 1. Python 🐍
**Why?** Best for backend development, AI/ML, and automation.

### 🔹 Backend Web Development:
- **Django** - Full-stack framework
- **Flask** - Lightweight & fast
- **FastAPI** - Best for APIs

### 🔹 Data Science & Machine Learning:
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** - Deep Learning
- **Pandas / NumPy** - Data analysis
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine Learning

### 🔹 Automation & Scripting:
- **Selenium** - Web automation
- **BeautifulSoup / Scrapy** - Web scraping

✅ **Start with:** Flask for APIs, Pandas for data, FastAPI for scalable backend development.

---

## 🌐 2. JavaScript  
**Why?** Essential for **web development (frontend & backend).**

### 🔹 Frontend Frameworks:
- **React.js** - Most popular for UI
- **Next.js** - SEO-friendly React framework
- **Vue.js** - Easier alternative to React

### 🔹 Backend (Full Stack) Frameworks:
- **Node.js** - Server-side JS runtime
- **Express.js** - Lightweight web framework
- **NestJS** - Scalable backend framework

### 🔹 Databases & APIs:
- **GraphQL** - Alternative to REST APIs
- **Firebase** - Serverless database for JS apps

✅ **Start with:** React for frontend, Node.js + Express for backend.

---

## ☕ 3. Java
**Why?** Best for **backend development, enterprise apps, and Android.**

### 🔹 Backend Web Development:
- **Spring Boot** - Most used for backend APIs
- **Hibernate** - ORM for databases

### 🔹 Android Development:
- **Android SDK + Jetpack** - For mobile apps
- **Kotlin** - Interoperable with Java

### 🔹 Enterprise & Cloud Applications:
- **Jakarta EE** - Enterprise Java
- **Micronaut** - Cloud-native apps

✅ **Start with:** Spring Boot for backend development.

---

## 🗄️ 4. SQL
**Why?** **Every backend & data-driven app needs SQL for databases.**

### 🔹 Databases & Tools:
- **PostgreSQL** - Best open-source SQL database
- **MySQL** - Widely used for web apps
- **SQLite** - Lightweight, used in mobile apps

### 🔹 ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Frameworks:
- **SQLAlchemy** - For Python apps
- **Prisma** - For JavaScript & TypeScript
- **Hibernate** - For Java

### 🔹 Big Data & Cloud Integration:
- **Google BigQuery** - Cloud-based SQL
- **AWS RDS** - Managed SQL databases

✅ **Start with:** PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy or Prisma for backend projects.

---

## 🏎️ 5. Go (Golang)
**Why?** Best for **high-performance backend, cloud computing, and microservices.**

### 🔹 Web Frameworks & APIs:
- **Gin** - Most popular for web APIs
- **Fiber** - Fast & minimalistic
- **Echo** - Simple but powerful

### 🔹 Cloud & Distributed Systems:
- **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration
- **Docker** - Containerized applications

### 🔹 Concurrency & High Performance:
- **gRPC** - Fast remote procedure calls
- **Cobra** - CLI applications

✅ **Start with:** Gin for building web APIs and Docker for deployment.
