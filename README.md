## 💡 Idea #1: Online Job Application Tracker

### 📌 Objective  
Develop a web platform to help users **track, organize, and manage job applications** using automation and AI.

### 🔹 Key Features  
- **Automated Tracking** – Users can manually input job applications or paste job descriptions.  
- **Email Integration** – Connect with Gmail to detect job-related emails and update application status.  
- **LinkedIn Search** – Find PSU alumni or employees at applied companies.  
- **AI Insights** – Use DeepSeek API or a custom AI model to extract recruiter emails and summarize job postings.  
- **Dashboard** – Track applications with categories:  
  - **Hot** – Responses received  
  - **Cold** – No response yet  
  - **Dead** – Rejected applications  
- **User Customization** – Mark emails as read, update application status, and generate local backups in CSV, JSON, or PDF.  
- **Report Generation** – Send job summaries via email.  
- **Explainer Video** – Consider outsourcing to Fiverr for a promotional video.  

### 🛠 Technologies  
- AWS, Flask/Django, React/Next.js, PostgreSQL/MySQL, Gmail API, LinkedIn API, AI Summarization  

A streamlined system to help job seekers efficiently track applications and follow up on opportunities.
